# eink-test-1 README

It's a VS Code theme for an electronic paper (e-ink, whatever you call it) monitor, because I couldn't find a good theme that already existed.  Apparently the fact that it's based on high-contrast is noteworthy.  (Pro-tip: if you want to create a color theme that functions well in a monochrome or limited-color environment, make it a high-contrast theme.  This is the intended purpose of high-contrast.)

I haven't tested it much, and what testing I have done has mostly been in Python.  Basically, feel free to give it a try, but I don't promise it'll actually work well for you.
